## Intro
This package is designed to make building client side code easy whilst keeping the build file standardised. 

A standardised build file results in less time writing the build file and more time building the app which is in everyone's book a better use of time.

Use quilk to build:
- CSS files from SCSS or LESS files or multiple CSS files.
- JS app and vendor files from es5/es6 js files.
- Copy assets from dev to production folders.
- Watch dev environments to automatically rebuild.
- Sync single file changes to a development server with rsync to improve communication between teams.
- Pack and minify code for production.
