#quilk todo list/wishlist

1.  Write a quilk core module for [babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify)
1.  Move the ugly README.md to a pretty documentation site with something like [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) or similar. Had a quick play with jsdoc and although amazing, might not be best suited for quilk. Works great for libs like lodash and async, but they are libraries of code opposed to programs :/ Potentials...
