In brief, quilk is a lightweight module runner that will compile sass, less, browserify files. Concat big client side application js or css. Obfusicate, minify javascript or sqwish css. Ping messages via email or webhooks when a build was successful or a giant failure. Offset your developers working environments to a standardized server for the ultimate team collaboration setup. Use quilk to compile client side code for multiple environments.

And.

All with a single json file. No more whacky project build files, just a structured json file. 

A lot more under the hood, check the documentation page for more.

### Last commit
Extended the sass_std module. You can now add an array of static CSS files that will be added to the SASS generated CSS. To just, just add a numeric array of paths relative to your quilk.json. Full example here: (https://johnc1984.github.io/quilk/Modules_baked_in/sass_std.html)
