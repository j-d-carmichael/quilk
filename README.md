In brief, quilk is a lightweight module runner that will compile sass, less, browserify files. Concat big client side application js or css. Obfusicate, minify javascript or sqwish css. Ping messages via email or webhooks when a build was successful or a giant failure. Offset your developers working environments to a standardized server for the ultimate team collaboration setup. Use quilk to compile client side code for multiple environments.

And.

All with a single json file. No more whacky project build files, just a structured json file. 

A lot more under the hood, check the documentation page for more.

*If anyone fancies helping [evolve](https://github.com/johnc1984/quilk/) quilk give me a shout, many [skilled] hands make light work.*


### Last commit
New module "command_run". Does what it's name might suggest... it runs commands on the command line... eg "bower install".

### Next
Option to use either a quilk.json or a quilk.js file. Writing json is not that fun :/
