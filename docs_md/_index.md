## Intro
Quilk began as a single script which utilized the popular node-sass npm package plus the nice and light concat-files npm package together with the snappy chokidar file watcher. The result was a working solution for lower spec machines that was still rapid fast and didn't require `npm install` to download the entire internet.

As quilk grew and was being used in more projects, the configuration nature of quilk started to emerge. Using the same script on different projects but with just altering a few lines of a JSON file meant projects were setup in no time, and it was no longer possible to create a whacky build file... Roll forward to today and I use quilk in many projects using most of the std tools from sass to less to browserify.
